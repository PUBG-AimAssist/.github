# PUBG Aim Assist

In **PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS**, every encounter is a held breath. The map is wide, the weapons unforgiving, and the smallest tremor in your aim can decide whether you walk away—or fall silently into the grass. Aim is not just mechanics here; it is nerve, timing, and control.

**PUBG Aim Assist** is a focused PC software tool designed to steady that moment. It doesn’t turn chaos into certainty—it turns hesitation into intention, giving you smoother tracking, cleaner recoil handling, and a clearer connection between sight and shot.

## 🎯 Overview: Precision Without Losing the Feel

PUBG’s gunplay is famous for its recoil patterns and raw ballistics. This aim assist respects that identity while offering **subtle, configurable assistance** that helps you stay on target during high-pressure fights.

With the tool enabled, you can:

* Track moving targets more consistently
* Reduce recoil-induced drift during sprays
* Fine-tune aim behavior for different weapon classes

Think of it as a stabilizing hand—not an autopilot.

## 👁 Aim Assist Core Modules

Each module is optional, adjustable, and designed to blend into natural gameplay.

### 🎯 Target Tracking Assist

* Soft aim magnetism within a defined FOV
* Adjustable strength and smoothing
* Priority targeting (closest / lowest HP / center mass)

Best used at low values, where assistance feels almost invisible.

### 🔫 Recoil & Spray Control

* Vertical recoil dampening
* Horizontal spray smoothing
* Weapon-specific profiles (AR, DMR, SMG)

Your crosshair still moves—just with less resistance from chaos.

### 🧭 Aim Smoothing & Sensitivity Sync

* Mouse input smoothing
* Dynamic sensitivity scaling while firing
* ADS-only assistance

This keeps muscle memory intact while reducing micro-jitter in firefights.

* Stronger smoothing in close combat
* Dynamic scaling based on zoom level

### Humanization Controls
